        <p>
            <i>After a one-hour call, a startup establishing the digital economy successfully secured $1.5 million in a Co-founder round to develop the digital economy ecosystem.</i>
        </p>

        <p>With a roadmap of 7 investment rounds: co-founder, angel, Series A, B, C, PE, and IB, the company declared that it has met the IPO target of $300 billion USD by 2027.</p>
        
        <p>CMC Holdings will use the funds raised to establish a digital ecosystem across several platforms, fulfilling the requirements of billions of consumers throughout the world.</p>

        <p>Hyperas Chain - a specialized platform for coding assets, Pindias - a transaction management platform for digital asset logs, Divega - an auction e-commerce platform, and Rapital Bank - a digital banking service available anytime, are all part of CMC Holdings' digital ecosystem.</p>

        <p >CMC Holdings' digital ecosystem is presented by Mr. Chung.</p>
        <p>According to the strategy, CMC Holdings will roll out these major initiatives in 2022 and 2023, with coding assets, auction platforms, and digital banking services.</p>
        <p>CMC Holdings has invested a significant amount of time examining the market and long-term business models.</p>
        
        <p>From the beginning, CMC Holdings has focused on solving social problems and sustainable development. </p>
        <p>It attaches great importance to social values and focuses on the vital core areas of this world.</p>
        <p>Divega is the SIB (Social Impact Business) model. The project not only gives a place to trade genuine and limited goods at "unbelievable" prices under the lowest auction but the profits will be used for society's charity.</p>
        <p>Co-founders who are also business owners and individual investors successfully raised the first round of investment. </p>
        <p>Most investors' selections are based on a thorough grasp of the digital economy's value to the market, as well as extensive proof of successful enterprises over time. </p>
        <p>Mr. Tran Nam Chung, chairman of CMC Holdings, believes that the expansion of the digital economy is clear when discussing the business plan. </p>
        <p>It affects retail, e-commerce, fintech, AI, VR, AR, blockchain, and more.</p>

        <p >That is, however, merely a required requirement.</p>

        <p>
            Mr. Chung believes that having breakthrough ideas, as well as a self-contained and expanding ecosystem to suit the increasing needs of consumers, is a sufficient condition for these opportunities to materialize. CMC Holdings, in particular, must establish and utilize the crucial leverage: finance, branding, and technology, in order to be successful in sustainable growth.
